RIVERS OF NEPAL

MAJOR RIVER SYSTEMS
Nepal's river systems are among the most dramatic and important geographical features of the country. All rivers in Nepal ultimately flow southward from the Himalayas into the Ganges River system in India, eventually reaching the Bay of Bengal. Nepal has three major river systems: the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali, which together drain the entire country. These rivers are fed by snowmelt from the Himalayas and monsoon rains, making them perennial.

The rivers of Nepal are crucial for agriculture, providing irrigation to farmlands; for hydroelectric power generation; for transportation in some areas; for religious and cultural purposes; and for adventure tourism including rafting and kayaking. However, they also pose challenges through annual flooding during monsoon season and erosion of riverbanks.

KOSHI RIVER SYSTEM
The Koshi River, also known as Sapta Koshi (Seven Koshi), is the largest river system in Nepal and one of the largest tributaries of the Ganges. The name "Sapta Koshi" refers to seven tributaries that merge to form this mighty river: Sun Koshi, Indravati, Bhote Koshi, Dudh Koshi, Arun, Barun, and Tamur.

The Koshi originates from the Tibetan Plateau and flows through eastern Nepal before entering India. The total length of the Koshi is approximately 729 kilometers. The Arun River, one of its major tributaries, is unique as it is an antecedent river that predates the formation of the Himalayas, cutting through the mountain range.

The Koshi basin covers an area of about 60,400 square kilometers in Nepal and is known for its devastating floods. The river carries enormous amounts of sediment, earning it the nickname "Sorrow of Bihar" in India due to frequent floods and course changes. The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, located in the river's floodplain, is an important wetland habitat for migratory birds and the last remaining population of wild water buffalo in Nepal.

The Koshi Barrage, built in 1962 near the Nepal-India border, is a major infrastructure project for flood control and irrigation. The river system has significant potential for hydroelectric power generation, with multiple projects proposed or under construction.

GANDAKI RIVER SYSTEM
The Gandaki River system, also called Narayani in its lower reaches and Sapta Gandaki (Seven Gandaki), is the second-largest river system in Nepal. The seven main tributaries are Kali Gandaki, Trisuli, Budhi Gandaki, Marsyangdi, Daraundi, Seti, and Madi.

The Kali Gandaki, the main tributary, is renowned as one of the deepest gorges in the world. It flows between the Dhaulagiri (8,167m) and Annapurna (8,091m) mountain ranges, creating a gorge over 6,000 meters deep. The Kali Gandaki is also famous for the fossilized ammonites (shaligrams) found in its upper reaches, which are considered sacred in Hindu religion.

The Trisuli River is one of Nepal's most popular rivers for white-water rafting and is easily accessible from Kathmandu. It eventually joins with other tributaries to form the Gandaki. The Marsyangdi River, meaning "Raging River" in Nepali, is famous for its challenging rapids and is considered one of the best white-water rafting destinations in the world.

The Gandaki River basin covers approximately 46,300 square kilometers in Nepal. The river system flows through central Nepal, providing water for irrigation, particularly in the Chitwan and Nawalpur districts. After merging with the Kali Gandaki, the river is called Narayani and flows into India where it joins the Ganges.

Major hydroelectric projects on the Gandaki system include the Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Project, Kali Gandaki Hydroelectric Project (144 MW), and the Upper Trishuli-1 project. The river system has enormous untapped potential for hydropower development.

KARNALI RIVER SYSTEM
The Karnali is the longest river in Nepal, stretching approximately 507 kilometers before entering India. It originates from the Tibetan Plateau near Mount Kailash and flows through the remote western region of Nepal. The major tributaries include Humla Karnali, Mugu Karnali, Seti Karnali, and Bheri River.

The Karnali basin is the largest river basin in Nepal, covering about 44,000 square kilometers, but it is the least developed region of the country. The river flows through pristine wilderness areas and is known for its biodiversity. The Karnali region is home to Bardia National Park, famous for tigers, one-horned rhinoceros, and wild elephants.

The Karnali offers some of the most remote and challenging white-water rafting expeditions in Nepal, taking adventurers through isolated gorges and unspoiled landscapes. The journey typically takes 10-12 days and offers an authentic wilderness experience.

The Karnali has significant hydropower potential, with the proposed Karnali Chisapani project potentially being one of Nepal's largest. However, the region's remoteness and difficult terrain pose challenges for development. The river eventually enters India where it is known as Ghagra and joins the Ganges.

BAGMATI RIVER
The Bagmati is perhaps Nepal's most culturally significant river despite being smaller than the major river systems. It originates in the Shivapuri hills north of Kathmandu and flows through the Kathmandu Valley before joining the Ganges system in India.

The Bagmati is considered sacred in Hindu religion, and the Pashupatinath Temple, one of the most important Shiva temples in the world, sits on its banks. Hindu cremation ceremonies are performed along the Bagmati at Pashupatinath and other ghats. The river plays a central role in religious festivals and rituals.

Unfortunately, the Bagmati has become severely polluted due to urbanization, with untreated sewage and industrial waste flowing into it. The Bagmati Action Plan has been initiated to clean and restore the river, with some success in recent years. The river's length is about 597 kilometers, of which 195 kilometers flow through Nepal.

Major tributaries of the Bagmati include the Bishnumati, Manohara, and Hanumante rivers. The Bagmati corridor is densely populated and includes the capital city of Kathmandu, making water management and pollution control critical challenges.

MAHAKALI RIVER
The Mahakali River forms the western border between Nepal and India for much of its length. It originates in the Great Himalayas at an elevation of about 3,600 meters and is also known as Sharda in India and Kali in some sections. The river's total length is approximately 350 kilometers.

The Mahakali basin covers about 15,260 square kilometers in Nepal. The river and its tributaries, including Chamelia and Seti, have significant hydropower potential. The Mahakali Treaty between Nepal and India governs the utilization of the river's water resources.

The Mahakali is an important river for irrigation in both Nepal and India. The Tanakpur Barrage and Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project are major infrastructure developments on this river, though the latter remains under construction with various delays.

RAPTI RIVER
There are two Rapti Rivers in Nepal: the West Rapti and East Rapti. The West Rapti flows through western Nepal, passes through Dang Valley, and is a major tributary of the Karnali system. The East Rapti flows through Chitwan and is a tributary of the Gandaki system.

The East Rapti is particularly important as it flows through Chitwan National Park and provides vital habitat for diverse wildlife. The river supports irrigation for agriculture in the Chitwan Valley, one of Nepal's most productive agricultural regions.

KAMALA RIVER
The Kamala River flows through eastern Nepal in the Terai region. It originates in the Mahabharat Range and flows southward into India. The river is important for irrigation in Dhanusha and Siraha districts but is prone to flooding during monsoon season.

TINAU RIVER
The Tinau River flows through Rupandehi district in western Nepal, passing by Butwal city. It originates from the Mahabharat hills and flows into India. The river has religious significance and supports irrigation for agriculture in the region.

KANKAI RIVER
The Kankai River flows through eastern Nepal, mainly in Jhapa and Ilam districts. It originates in the Mahabharat Range and flows into India where it joins the Mahananda River. The Kankai is important for irrigation and fishing.

MECHI RIVER
The Mechi River forms part of the eastern border of Nepal with India. It originates in the Mahabharat Range and flows through the Mechi Zone (now part of Koshi Province). The river is relatively short but is important as a border river and for local agriculture.

HYDROELECTRIC POTENTIAL
Nepal's rivers have an estimated hydroelectric potential of 83,000 MW, making it one of the richest countries in the world in terms of water resources relative to size. However, only about 2,000 MW has been developed so far. Major hydroelectric projects include:

- Kali Gandaki A Hydroelectric Project (144 MW)
- Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Project (70 MW)
- Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (456 MW)
- Chilime Hydropower Plant (22.1 MW)
- Numerous small and medium projects across various rivers

The development of hydropower is seen as crucial for Nepal's economic development and energy security. Several large projects are under construction or in planning stages, including projects on the Karnali, Arun, and Upper Karnali rivers.

RIVER CONSERVATION CHALLENGES
Nepal's rivers face several challenges including pollution from urban areas, industrial waste, plastic waste, deforestation leading to soil erosion and sedimentation, encroachment on riverbanks, sand and gravel mining, and climate change affecting glacial melt and water flow patterns.

Various conservation efforts are underway, including the Bagmati Cleanup Campaign, river monitoring programs, regulations on mining, and community-based river management initiatives. However, balancing development needs with environmental conservation remains an ongoing challenge for Nepal.
