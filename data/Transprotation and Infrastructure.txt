TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN NEPAL

ROAD NETWORK

OVERVIEW AND EXTENT
Nepal's road network has expanded dramatically from virtually nothing in the 1950s to approximately 64,000 kilometers today. However, the quality and accessibility of roads vary significantly. The network includes national highways (strategic roads), feeder roads, district roads, and urban roads. Only about 60% of roads are paved (blacktopped), with the remainder being gravel or earth roads that become difficult or impassable during monsoon season.

The mountainous terrain makes road construction expensive and challenging. Roads often follow river valleys and ridges, resulting in winding routes with steep gradients. Landslides during monsoon and earthquakes frequently damage roads, requiring constant maintenance. Many remote areas still lack road access, with residents depending on trails for transportation.

MAJOR HIGHWAYS

EAST-WEST HIGHWAY (MAHENDRA HIGHWAY)
The East-West Highway, also called Mahendra Highway, is Nepal's longest and most important road, stretching approximately 1,028 kilometers across the Terai from Mechi Bridge in the east to Mahakali Bridge in the west. Completed in sections over decades with the final connection in 2000, this highway links the entire length of Nepal's southern plains.

The highway passes through major cities including Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bharatpur, Butwal, and Dhangadhi. It serves as the main artery for internal trade and transportation, connecting the Terai's agricultural and industrial regions. The road's condition varies by section, with some stretches well-maintained while others have potholes and damage. Traffic is heavy, particularly trucks carrying goods between India and Nepal and along the highway.

PRITHVI HIGHWAY
The Prithvi Highway connects Kathmandu with Pokhara and extends to the Indian border at Sunauli, spanning about 200 kilometers. This is one of Nepal's most important and heavily traveled roads, linking the capital to the second-largest city and serving as a key connection to India. The highway follows the Trishuli and Marshyangdi river valleys with scenic but challenging terrain.

The road experiences heavy traffic including tourist buses, commercial trucks, and private vehicles. Landslides during monsoon frequently disrupt traffic. The government has been working on expansion and improvement, though progress has been slow. Alternative routes and bypasses are being considered to reduce congestion.

TRIBHUVAN HIGHWAY (NEPAL'S FIRST HIGHWAY)
The Tribhuvan Highway, Nepal's first highway, connects Kathmandu with the Terai at Hetauda and continues to the Indian border at Birgunj. Built with Indian assistance and opened in 1956, this 159-kilometer road marked a milestone in Nepal's development, ending Kathmandu's isolation. The road climbs from the Terai through the Siwalik hills to reach the Kathmandu Valley at 1,400 meters elevation.

The highway includes the dramatic Daman section with viewpoints offering Himalayan vistas. However, the road is steep with sharp curves and is prone to landslides and damage. Traffic has shifted to other routes, particularly the longer but easier Prithvi Highway, but Tribhuvan Highway remains important for southern Kathmandu Valley access.

ARANIKO HIGHWAY
The Araniko Highway connects Kathmandu with Tibet (China) at the Rasuwagadhi-Tatopani border, spanning about 112 kilometers. Named after the famous Nepali architect who traveled to China in the 13th century, this highway is crucial for Nepal-China trade. The road follows the Bhote Koshi river valley with steep terrain and numerous bridges.

The 2015 earthquake severely damaged this highway, causing landslides and destroying sections. Reconstruction has been ongoing. When fully operational, the highway facilitates significant trade with China, though volumes remain far below India trade. The route is popular with tourists heading to Tibet.

BP KOIRALA HIGHWAY (BANEPA-BARDIBAS)
This highway connects the Kathmandu Valley with the eastern Terai, providing an alternative to the Tribhuvan Highway for eastern destinations. The road spans about 157 kilometers from Dhulikhel (near Kathmandu) through Sindhuli to Bardibas in the Terai. Completed relatively recently after decades of construction, it has reduced travel time between Kathmandu and eastern regions.

The highway passes through diverse terrain including mountains and hills with significant elevation changes. Its completion improved connectivity for districts that were previously difficult to access.

KARNALI HIGHWAY
The Karnali Highway provides access to the remote northwestern Karnali region, considered one of Nepal's most challenging roads. Running through Surkhet to Jumla and beyond, this road experiences extreme conditions including landslides, snow, and river crossings. Many sections remain unpaved, and the road is often closed during winter and monsoon seasons. Despite difficulties, it has been transformational for the remote districts it serves, reducing travel times from weeks of trekking to hours or days of driving.

MID-HILLS HIGHWAY
The Mid-Hills Highway (Pushpalal Highway), when completed, will run the length of Nepal through the mid-hills from east to west, providing an alternative to the Terai highway and connecting hill communities. Construction has been ongoing for decades with significant sections completed but gaps remaining. The highway will reduce travel distances between hill areas and improve access to remote regions. However, challenging terrain and limited funding have slowed progress.

URBAN ROADS AND RING ROADS
Major cities have developed road networks including ring roads to manage traffic flow. Kathmandu's ring road encircles the valley, though it has become heavily congested. New ring roads and expressways are being planned to handle growing traffic. Urban roads often suffer from poor maintenance, encroachment, and inadequate drainage. Traffic congestion is severe in Kathmandu and other growing cities during peak hours.

ROAD CONDITIONS AND CHALLENGES
Road quality varies dramatically. Major highways connecting cities generally have blacktopped surfaces, though with varying quality and maintenance. Feeder and district roads are often unpaved gravel or earth roads. Monsoon season causes significant damage through landslides, erosion, and washouts. Winter brings snow and ice to high-altitude roads, making them impassable.

Maintenance is inadequate due to limited budgets and capacity. Roads deteriorate quickly under heavy traffic and environmental stresses. Overloaded trucks damage road surfaces. Political considerations sometimes influence road construction priorities over technical and economic factors. Corruption in construction leads to substandard roads that quickly degrade.

AIR TRANSPORTATION

AIRPORTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Nepal has one international airport and numerous domestic airports and airstrips. Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu is Nepal's only significant international airport, handling all international traffic and major domestic flights. Located in the Kathmandu Valley, it has limitations including single runway, capacity constraints, and weather-related disruptions.

Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa (Lumbini Province) opened in 2022 as Nepal's second international airport. It aims to boost Buddhist tourism and improve connectivity to western Nepal. Pokhara Regional International Airport opened in 2023 to serve as a tourist gateway, though international operations remain limited.

Domestic airports include Biratnagar, Dhangadhi, Nepalgunj, Bharatpur, and Janakpur, which have paved runways and regular flights. Lukla Airport (Tenzing-Hillary Airport) is famous as the gateway to Everest, considered one of the world's most dangerous airports due to its short sloped runway in mountainous terrain. Jomsom, Simikot, Jumla, Dolpa, and other remote airports serve mountain regions with small aircraft, though flights are frequently canceled due to weather.

Many remote districts have small airstrips (STOL - Short Takeoff and Landing) serving as the only alternative to trekking. These airstrips are often unpaved and weather-dependent. Helicopter services have expanded significantly, used for mountain regions, medical evacuations, tourism, and increasingly for transportation where roads are inadequate.

AIRLINES
Nepal Airlines, the national flag carrier, operates international flights to nearby countries including India, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Qatar, and Bangladesh, plus domestic flights. However, it has struggled with old aircraft, poor management, and safety concerns. European Union banned Nepal Airlines from its airspace for years due to safety issues.

Private airlines dominate domestic aviation. Major operators include Yeti Airlines, Buddha Air, Shree Airlines, and Saurya Airlines. These airlines connect Kathmandu with regional cities and mountain destinations. However, the domestic aviation sector has been marred by safety concerns with several fatal accidents in recent years due to challenging terrain, weather, and sometimes inadequate maintenance or pilot error.

International airlines serving Nepal include Air India, IndiGo, Thai Airways, Qatar Airways, Druk Air (Bhutan), China Southern, and others connecting Kathmandu to regional and international hubs. Growing tourism and business travel have increased international flight connectivity.

AIR TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES
Major challenges include mountainous terrain and weather creating dangerous flying conditions, inadequate infrastructure and navigation aids, safety record concerns affecting international confidence, limited airport capacity constraining growth, and seasonal fluctuations in demand making operations uneconomical in some periods. The government has worked to improve aviation safety standards to meet international requirements.

RAILWAY

LIMITED RAILWAY NETWORK
Nepal has minimal railway infrastructure compared to neighboring countries. Only two short railway lines operate. The Janakpur-Jayanagar line, built during British colonial period, connects Janakpur with the Indian border at Jayanagar, spanning about 29 kilometers. This narrow-gauge railway operates irregularly with old rolling stock and limited passenger service.

A railway line from Jayanagar continues to Kurtha in Nepal, recently constructed with Indian assistance. Plans exist to extend it further. Another railway project connects Raxaul (India) to Kathmandu, currently under discussion, which would transform Nepal's connectivity if realized. However, mountainous terrain makes railway construction extremely expensive and technically challenging.

CROSS-BORDER RAIL LINKS
Nepal's rail connectivity depends on India's railway system. Border towns like Birgunj, Biratnagar, Bhairahawa, and Nepalgunj are near Indian railway stations, allowing Nepalis to access India's extensive network. However, goods must be transferred from rail to road at borders, increasing costs and time.

FUTURE RAILWAY PLANS
The government envisions developing railway networks including a north-south railway connecting Nepal with Tibet (China), east-west railway through the Terai paralleling the highway, and electric railway in the Kathmandu Valley to address traffic congestion. These remain long-term visions requiring massive investment and technical expertise. Some experts question economic viability given terrain challenges and limited freight demand.

OTHER TRANSPORTATION

ROPEWAYS AND CABLE CARS
Cable cars serve tourist destinations including Manakamana Temple (one of Nepal's most successful commercial ropeways), Chandragiri Hills near Kathmandu, and other sites. These provide both tourist attractions and practical transportation alternatives in mountainous terrain. Smaller ropeways transport goods across rivers and to hilltop settlements in some areas.

The government has considered urban cable car systems for Kathmandu to reduce traffic congestion. Feasibility studies have been conducted though implementation has not occurred.

BRIDGES
Bridges are critical infrastructure in Nepal's mountainous terrain with numerous rivers. Major bridges include the Koshi Barrage near the Nepal-India border, bridges along the East-West Highway crossing major rivers, and suspension bridges in mountain areas. The Mahakali Bridge marks Nepal's western border with India.

Traditional suspension bridges using local materials (bamboo, rope, wood) still exist in remote areas, though increasingly replaced by steel suspension or wooden bridges. Bridge construction and maintenance is crucial for road network functionality as rivers often wash away temporary bridges during monsoon.

TRANSPORTATION IN URBAN AREAS

KATHMANDU VALLEY TRANSPORTATION
Kathmandu Valley faces severe transportation challenges from rapid urbanization and vehicle growth. Private vehicles including motorcycles, cars, and SUVs dominate, causing congestion and air pollution. Public transportation includes government-operated Sajha buses and private microbuses, tempos (three-wheelers), and taxis. However, public transport is inadequate for demand, uncomfortable, and unreliable.

Ride-sharing services like Pathao and Tootle (motorcycle taxis) have become popular in recent years. Traffic management is poor with inadequate traffic signals, police, and parking facilities. Pedestrian infrastructure is minimal with narrow, broken footpaths and lack of crossings. The government has long discussed but not implemented mass rapid transit systems like metro rail or bus rapid transit.

Ring road expansion and new road construction aim to ease congestion but often worsen problems by encouraging more vehicles. Air pollution from vehicles is a major health concern, particularly in winter when temperature inversion traps pollutants.

OTHER CITIES
Pokhara, Biratnagar, Birgunj, and other cities have growing vehicle populations and traffic management challenges, though less severe than Kathmandu. Public transportation in these cities primarily consists of local buses and tempos. Bicycles and motorcycles are popular for short distances. Walking remains common in smaller urban centers.

INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

ELECTRICITY AND POWER INFRASTRUCTURE
Power generation infrastructure includes hydropower plants, transmission lines, substations, and distribution networks. The transmission network connects major hydropower projects to load centers. Nepal Electricity Authority operates most transmission and distribution infrastructure. However, transmission capacity lags behind generation, causing bottlenecks.

Distribution infrastructure has expanded to reach most villages, though quality varies. Rural electrification has been prioritized with subsidies and community programs. Power losses during transmission and distribution remain high (15-20%) due to old infrastructure, theft, and technical losses.

WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION
Urban water supply systems exist in major cities, though supply is often inadequate and intermittent. Kathmandu faces severe water shortages with piped water available only a few hours per week in many areas. Private water tankers supplement official supply. Water quality concerns exist due to old pipes and potential contamination.

Rural water supply schemes using springs, wells, and tube wells provide drinking water, though quality and year-round availability vary. Many households still depend on traditional sources including springs and rivers. Sanitation infrastructure has improved with more households having toilets, though open defecation continues in some areas.

Sewerage systems exist in larger cities but coverage is limited. Most wastewater flows untreated into rivers. Kathmandu Valley's sewerage system is old and inadequate. Septic tanks are common in urban areas, though many are poorly maintained.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE
Mobile phone towers cover most populated areas with 4G networks in cities and along highways. However, remote mountain areas have limited or no coverage. Fiber optic networks have expanded, improving internet connectivity. However, bandwidth remains limited compared to demand, particularly during peak hours.

International connectivity depends on fiber optic links to India. Satellite internet serves some remote areas. The government aims to provide broadband internet access to all local government offices and communities, though implementation faces funding and technical challenges.

IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE
Irrigation canals, lift irrigation schemes, and tube wells provide water for agriculture. Large canal systems exist in the Terai including those from the Koshi and Mahakali barrages. However, many schemes are poorly maintained with low efficiency. Farmer-managed irrigation systems work better than government systems in many cases.

BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE
Building standards exist but enforcement is weak. The 2015 earthquake exposed widespread poor construction quality. Post-earthquake reconstruction emphasized earthquake-resistant building techniques. However, many buildings, including in cities, do not meet codes.

Housing shortage exists in urban areas with rapid population growth outpacing construction. Unplanned settlements and squatter colonies develop on public and private land. Building height restrictions in Kathmandu aim to preserve heritage and reduce earthquake risk but are often violated.

INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES
Major infrastructure challenges include inadequate investment with limited government budget, difficult terrain increasing construction costs, maintenance neglect with focus on new construction over upkeep, corruption and poor quality control, uncoordinated development among agencies, environmental concerns often ignored in infrastructure projects, and displacement and social issues from large projects.

Climate change threatens infrastructure through increased flooding, landslides, and extreme weather. Infrastructure must become more resilient to these threats.

ONGOING AND PLANNED PROJECTS
Major infrastructure projects include the Melamchi Water Supply Project to bring water to Kathmandu (recently completed after decades of delays and challenges), several large hydropower projects under construction, road improvement and new construction nationwide, Kathmandu-Tarai fast track road (expressway), international airport upgrades and new airports, cross-border railway projects with India, and power transmission lines and substations.

Many projects face delays, cost overruns, and implementation challenges. However, infrastructure investment is increasing with support from multilateral development banks, India, China, and other development partners. Infrastructure improvement is crucial for Nepal's economic development and poverty reduction.
