MOUNTAINS OF NEPAL

OVERVIEW
Nepal is home to eight of the world's fourteen peaks over 8,000 meters (26,247 feet), making it a premier destination for mountaineering and trekking. The Himalayas form the northern border of Nepal, stretching approximately 800 kilometers from west to east. The name "Himalaya" comes from Sanskrit, meaning "abode of snow." These mountains are not only geological wonders but also hold deep cultural and spiritual significance for local communities and are sacred in both Hindu and Buddhist traditions.

MOUNT EVEREST (SAGARMATHA/CHOMOLUNGMA)
Mount Everest, at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet), is the highest mountain in the world. In Nepali, it is called Sagarmatha, meaning "Forehead of the Sky," while in Tibetan, it is known as Chomolungma, meaning "Mother Goddess of the World." The mountain was named Everest after Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General of India, though this naming occurred without his approval.

Located in the Mahalangur Himal section of the Himalayas, Everest straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet. The mountain was first summited on May 29, 1953, by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa of Nepal, a momentous achievement in human history. Since then, thousands have attempted to reach its summit, with varying degrees of success.

The standard climbing route from Nepal is the South Col route, which begins from the Khumbu region. Climbers establish base camp at 5,364 meters and typically create four additional camps before attempting the summit. The climbing season is primarily in May when weather conditions are most favorable, creating a brief "weather window" for summit attempts.

Everest faces modern challenges including overcrowding during peak season, environmental degradation from climbing expeditions, the removal of accumulated waste and bodies, and the impacts of climate change on glaciers and icefalls. The Khumbu Icefall, between base camp and Camp I, is considered one of the most dangerous sections due to constantly shifting ice.

The mountain generates significant revenue for Nepal through climbing permits, which cost $11,000 per person for foreigners during peak season. The Sherpa people, indigenous to the Everest region, serve as guides, porters, and high-altitude workers, with their lives and livelihoods intimately connected to the mountain.

KANGCHENJUNGA
Kangchenjunga, at 8,586 meters (28,169 feet), is the third-highest mountain in the world and the second-highest in Nepal. The name means "Five Treasures of Snow," referring to its five peaks. The mountain straddles the border between Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim and is considered sacred by local populations.

Kangchenjunga was first climbed in 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band of a British expedition. Out of respect for local beliefs, climbers traditionally stop just short of the actual summit. The mountain is less frequented than Everest, making it a destination for experienced mountaineers seeking a more challenging and less crowded climb.

The Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, established in 1997, protects 2,035 square kilometers of diverse ecosystems around the mountain. The area is home to endangered species including the snow leopard, red panda, and Himalayan black bear. The region retains much of its traditional character, with Buddhist monasteries and Sherpa and Limbu communities maintaining their cultural practices.

LHOTSE
Lhotse, at 8,516 meters (27,940 feet), is the fourth-highest mountain in the world. Its name means "South Peak" in Tibetan, as it is connected to Everest via the South Col. Lhotse is notable for its dramatic south face, a 3,000-meter wall of rock and ice considered one of the most challenging climbs in mountaineering.

The mountain was first summited in 1956 by a Swiss team. While climbing Lhotse shares much of the route with Everest climbers up to the South Col, it then diverges toward its own distinct summit. Despite its height and proximity to Everest, Lhotse receives far fewer climbers, offering a less commercialized climbing experience.

MAKALU
Makalu, at 8,485 meters (27,838 feet), is the fifth-highest mountain in the world. Located southeast of Everest, Makalu is known for its distinctive pyramid shape and steep pitches. The mountain takes its name from the Sanskrit word "Maha-Kala," meaning "Great Black," referring to its dark granite faces.

First climbed in 1955 by a French expedition, Makalu is considered one of the more difficult 8,000-meter peaks due to its technical challenges and harsh weather. The Makalu-Barun National Park, established in 1992, surrounds the mountain and protects one of the world's most pristine mountain ecosystems with exceptional biodiversity.

CHO OYU
Cho Oyu, at 8,188 meters (26,864 feet), is the sixth-highest mountain in the world, located on the Nepal-Tibet border west of Everest. The name means "Turquoise Goddess" in Tibetan. Cho Oyu is considered one of the more accessible 8,000-meter peaks, with a relatively moderate climbing route, making it popular among mountaineers.

The mountain was first climbed in 1954 by an Austrian expedition. The standard northwest ridge route from Tibet is the most common, though climbers also approach from the Nepali side. Cho Oyu's accessibility has made it a training ground for climbers preparing for more challenging peaks like Everest.

DHAULAGIRI
Dhaulagiri I, at 8,167 meters (26,795 feet), is the seventh-highest mountain in the world. The name comes from Sanskrit, meaning "White Mountain." Located in north-central Nepal, Dhaulagiri was once thought to be the highest mountain in the world until Kangchenjunga and then Everest were measured.

The mountain stood unclimbed until 1960 when a Swiss/Austrian expedition successfully reached its summit. Dhaulagiri is known for its enormous south face and challenging climbing conditions. The Dhaulagiri massif includes several subsidiary peaks, and the area offers spectacular trekking routes including the Dhaulagiri Circuit.

MANASLU
Manaslu, at 8,163 meters (26,781 feet), is the eighth-highest mountain in the world. Located in the Mansiri Himal region of west-central Nepal, the name comes from Sanskrit "Manasa," meaning "Mountain of the Spirit." The mountain is located in the remote Gorkha district.

First climbed in 1956 by a Japanese expedition, Manaslu has a special connection with Japanese mountaineering. The Manaslu Conservation Area, established in 1998, protects 1,663 square kilometers around the mountain. The Manaslu Circuit Trek is increasingly popular, offering views of the mountain and passage through diverse landscapes and traditional villages.

ANNAPURNA
Annapurna I, at 8,091 meters (26,545 feet), is the tenth-highest mountain in the world but holds historical significance as the first 8,000-meter peak to be climbed. A French expedition led by Maurice Herzog reached the summit in 1950, a groundbreaking achievement in mountaineering history.

The name "Annapurna" comes from Sanskrit meaning "Goddess of Food" or "Goddess of Plenty." Despite not being the highest, Annapurna has one of the highest fatality rates of all 8,000-meter peaks, with its south face being particularly treacherous. The Annapurna massif includes several peaks and forms the backdrop to Pokhara city.

The Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal's largest protected area at 7,629 square kilometers, encompasses the mountain range. The region is famous for trekking, with the Annapurna Circuit and Annapurna Base Camp treks being among the world's most popular, attracting hundreds of thousands of trekkers annually.

OTHER NOTABLE PEAKS

MACHHAPUCHHRE (FISHTAIL MOUNTAIN)
Machhapuchhre, at 6,993 meters (22,943 feet), is perhaps Nepal's most recognizable peak due to its distinctive double summit resembling a fish's tail. Located in the Annapurna range near Pokhara, the mountain is considered sacred and has never been summited—climbing it is prohibited. The only attempt was in 1957 when a British team stopped just 50 meters below the summit out of respect for local beliefs.

AMA DABLAM
Ama Dablam, at 6,812 meters (22,349 feet), is often called the "Matterhorn of the Himalayas" due to its dramatic appearance. Located in the Khumbu region near Everest, the name means "Mother's Necklace," referring to the long ridges on each side like a mother's arms protecting her child, and the hanging glacier resembling a dablam (traditional double-pendant worn by Sherpa women).

First climbed in 1961, Ama Dablam is a highly sought-after peak for mountaineers due to its aesthetic beauty and technical climbing challenges. The mountain is visible from many points along the Everest Base Camp trek and is considered one of the most beautiful mountains in the world.

PUMORI
Pumori, at 7,161 meters (23,494 feet), means "Unmarried Daughter" in Sherpa language. Located just west of Everest, it was named by George Mallory. The mountain offers spectacular views of Everest and is popular among climbers. First summited in 1962, Pumori provides challenging climbing routes and stunning scenery.

NUPTSE
Nuptse, at 7,861 meters (25,791 feet), means "West Peak" in Tibetan. It forms part of the Everest massif, standing southwest of Everest. The mountain has multiple summits along its ridge and was first climbed in 1961. Nuptse's massive south face is one of the great walls of the Himalayas.

MOUNTAINEERING CULTURE AND ECONOMY
Mountaineering has profound impacts on Nepal's economy and culture. The Sherpa people, originally from Tibet but settled in Nepal's high regions for centuries, have become synonymous with high-altitude mountaineering. Their physiological adaptations to high altitude, combined with generations of mountain experience, make them invaluable guides and support staff.

The Nepal Mountaineering Association regulates climbing activities, while the government issues permits through the Department of Tourism. Permit fees provide significant revenue, with Everest permits alone generating millions of dollars annually. The climbing industry supports thousands of families through direct employment as guides, porters, cooks, and support staff, as well as indirect employment in hotels, restaurants, and equipment shops.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
The mountains face numerous environmental challenges including waste accumulation from expeditions, human waste issues at high camps, climate change affecting glaciers and permafrost, increased rockfall and avalanche risk due to warming, and ecosystem disruption from tourism development.

Organizations like the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee work to manage waste and preserve the mountain environment. Recent initiatives include mandatory waste deposit systems, clean-up expeditions that have removed tons of garbage and abandoned climbing equipment, and stricter regulations on expedition conduct.

CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE
For local communities, mountains are not merely physical features but sacred beings. Many peaks are considered homes of gods and goddesses in both Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Sherpa people perform puja ceremonies before climbing expeditions, seeking blessings and permission from the mountain deities. Prayer flags, stupas, and mani walls in mountain regions reflect this spiritual relationship.

Mountains influence every aspect of life in mountain communities, from agriculture and trade to religious practices and festivals. The arrival of mountaineering and trekking tourism has brought economic benefits but also challenges to traditional ways of life.

MOUNTAINEERING HISTORY AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Nepal's mountaineering history includes pioneering first ascents, records for fastest climbs and most summits, tragedy and triumph including major disasters, international cooperation with climbers from many nations working together, and technological evolution in equipment and techniques.

Notable Nepali mountaineers include Apa Sherpa and Kami Rita Sherpa (multiple Everest summits), Pemba Dorje Sherpa (speed climbing records), and Nirmal Purja (Project Possible - 14 peaks in 6 months). These climbers have elevated Nepal's profile in mountaineering and inspired new generations.
