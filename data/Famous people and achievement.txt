HISTORICAL FIGURES

GAUTAMA BUDDHA (SIDDHARTHA GAUTAMA)
Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini, Nepal around 563 BCE as Prince Siddhartha Gautama. He was the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya Devi of the Shakya clan. After witnessing suffering in the form of old age, sickness, and death, he renounced his royal life at age 29 to seek enlightenment. After years of meditation and ascetic practices, he achieved enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, becoming the Buddha ("the enlightened one").

Buddha taught the Middle Way and the Four Noble Truths, forming the foundation of Buddhist philosophy. His teachings spread across Asia and eventually worldwide, influencing billions. Buddhism became a major world religion, though it declined in India while flourishing elsewhere. Buddha's birthplace in Lumbini remains one of the world's most important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists.
