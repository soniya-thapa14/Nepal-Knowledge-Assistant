HISTORY AND POLITICS OF NEPAL

ANCIENT HISTORY

PREHISTORIC AND LEGENDARY PERIOD
Archaeological evidence suggests human habitation in the Kathmandu Valley dates back to the Paleolithic era, approximately 11,000 years ago. The valley's fertile land and strategic location made it an attractive settlement site. According to legend, the valley was once a lake that was drained by the Bodhisattva Manjushri, who cut through the mountains at Chobar with his sword, allowing the water to flow out.

KIRAT DYNASTY
The Kirat people are considered among the earliest rulers of Nepal, with their reign traditionally dated from around 800 BCE. Kirat culture continues today through the Rai, Limbu, and other ethnic groups in eastern Nepal. The most famous Kirat king was Yalambar, mentioned in the Mahabharata epic. Kirat rule lasted for centuries until the arrival of the Licchavis.

LICCHAVI PERIOD (400-750 CE)
The Licchavi period marks the beginning of documented Nepali history with stone inscriptions. The Licchavis, who migrated from India, established a sophisticated kingdom in the Kathmandu Valley. They patronized arts, architecture, and Buddhism, building numerous temples and monuments. The Changu Narayan Temple, Nepal's oldest surviving temple, dates from this period.

Licchavi kings like Manadeva I left inscriptions documenting their achievements. The society was well-organized with a developed legal system, trade networks extending to Tibet and India, and advancement in arts and culture. This period saw the flourishing of Newari culture and language.

MEDIEVAL PERIOD

THAKURI DYNASTY (750-1200 CE)
After the Licchavi decline, various Thakuri dynasties ruled Nepal. King Gunakamadeva founded Kantipur (Kathmandu) during this period. Araniko, a famous Nepali artist, traveled to China in 1260 and influenced Tibetan and Chinese art and architecture. The period saw continued development of Newari culture and the growth of trade routes.

MALLA DYNASTY (1200-1769 CE)
The Malla period is considered the golden age of Nepali art, architecture, and culture. Initially ruling the unified Kathmandu Valley, the Mallas later divided into three kingdoms: Kathmandu, Patan (Lalitpur), and Bhaktapur (Bhadgaon), creating a period of both competition and cultural flowering.

The Malla kings were great patrons of arts, commissioning temples, palaces, and public buildings. Most of the Kathmandu Valley's architectural treasures date from this period, including the three Durbar Squares, numerous pagoda-style temples, and intricate wood and stone carvings. The kings sponsored festivals, promoted Sanskrit and Newari literature, and maintained sophisticated court cultures.

Notable Malla rulers include Jayasthiti Malla, who reorganized society and codified laws; Yaksha Malla, who expanded the kingdom; and Pratap Malla of Kathmandu, Siddhi Narasimha Malla of Patan, and Bhupatindra Malla of Bhaktapur, who competed in building magnificent monuments. However, the division of the valley into competing kingdoms ultimately weakened the Mallas.

UNIFICATION AND SHAH DYNASTY

PRITHVI NARAYAN SHAH AND UNIFICATION (1743-1775)
Prithvi Narayan Shah, the King of Gorkha (a small kingdom west of Kathmandu), envisioned unifying the scattered kingdoms into a single nation. Beginning in 1743, he launched a campaign to conquer the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding territories. After multiple attempts, he finally conquered Kathmandu in 1768, Patan in 1768, and Bhaktapur in 1769, unifying the valley.

Prithvi Narayan Shah is considered the founder of modern Nepal. He continued expanding Nepal's territory and established Kathmandu as the capital. He described Nepal as a "yam between two boulders" (referring to China and British India), advocating for independence and careful foreign relations. His successors continued expansion, extending Nepal's territory from Kashmir to Sikkim at its height.

ANGLO-NEPAL WAR (1814-1816)
Expansion brought Nepal into conflict with the British East India Company. The Anglo-Nepal War (also called the Gurkha War) lasted from 1814 to 1816. Despite fierce resistance and British difficulties in mountain warfare, Nepal ultimately signed the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816.

The treaty reduced Nepal's territory significantly, ceding one-third of its land including Sikkim, Kumaon, Garhwal, and parts of the Terai. However, Nepal maintained its independence, unlike other South Asian kingdoms. The British, impressed by Nepali soldiers' bravery, began recruiting Gurkha soldiers, a practice continuing today.

RANA REGIME (1846-1951)
In 1846, Jung Bahadur Rana consolidated power through the Kot Massacre, eliminating potential rivals. He established himself as Prime Minister and made the position hereditary within the Rana family, reducing the Shah kings to figureheads. The Rana regime, lasting 104 years, was autocratic and isolated Nepal from outside influences.

The Ranas maintained stability and Nepal's independence but prevented modernization and education to maintain control. They built grand palaces and maintained close relations with British India, providing Gurkha soldiers. However, the regime's authoritarianism and resistance to change eventually led to its downfall.

MODERN ERA

DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT AND END OF RANA RULE (1950-1951)
Opposition to Rana rule grew in the 1940s, influenced by India's independence movement and global democratic trends. King Tribhuvan, who had been reduced to a ceremonial role, allied with the Nepali Congress Party. In 1950, he fled to the Indian Embassy and then to India, sparking a revolution.

Armed resistance and negotiations led to the Delhi Compromise in 1951, ending Rana rule. King Tribhuvan returned as a constitutional monarch, and Nepal began its journey toward democracy and modernization. However, political instability and struggle between monarchy and democracy continued.

PANCHAYAT SYSTEM (1960-1990)
King Mahendra, who succeeded Tribhuvan in 1955, initially allowed democratic governance, but in 1960, he dismissed the elected government, claiming it was corrupt and ineffective. He established the Panchayat system, a partyless "guided democracy" where the king held absolute power.

The Panchayat era saw development in infrastructure, education, and administration, but political freedom was restricted. Opposition parties operated underground or in exile. King Birendra, who succeeded in 1972, continued the system but faced growing pro-democracy movements.

PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT (1990)
In early 1990, a mass movement (Jana Andolan) demanding democracy erupted across Nepal. Political parties, students, and citizens protested against the Panchayat system. Despite government repression and violence, the movement continued. Eventually, King Birendra agreed to political reforms.

A new constitution was promulgated in November 1990, establishing Nepal as a constitutional monarchy with multiparty democracy. The constitution guaranteed fundamental rights, press freedom, and independent judiciary. Parliamentary elections were held, and Nepal entered a new democratic era.

MAOIST INSURGENCY (1996-2006)
In 1996, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) launched a "People's War" against the government, citing corruption, poverty, and caste discrimination. The insurgency, initially dismissed by the government, grew into a full-scale civil war affecting much of rural Nepal.

The conflict intensified after the Royal Massacre in 2001, when Crown Prince Dipendra killed King Birendra and most of the royal family before killing himself (according to official reports, though conspiracy theories persist). Gyanendra became king in controversial circumstances.

King Gyanendra dismissed the government in 2005 and assumed direct rule, claiming it was necessary to defeat the Maoists. This autocratic move united political parties and Maoists against the monarchy, leading to the second People's Movement.

SECOND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT (2006)
In April 2006, a massive pro-democracy movement (Jana Andolan II) erupted with parties and Maoists jointly demanding restoration of democracy. Nineteen days of protests involving millions of people paralyzed the country. King Gyanendra was forced to restore parliament and accept democratic demands.

The reinstated parliament moved quickly to limit royal powers. A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed with Maoists in November 2006, officially ending the decade-long conflict that had claimed over 17,000 lives. The Maoists joined mainstream politics, and their combatants were integrated into society.

FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (2008-PRESENT)

ABOLITION OF MONARCHY
An interim constitution declared Nepal a federal democratic republic. Elections for the Constituent Assembly were held in 2008, with Maoists winning the largest share. On May 28, 2008, the newly elected Constituent Assembly officially abolished the 240-year-old monarchy, and Nepal became the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.

King Gyanendra vacated the palace and lost all official status. Ram Baran Yadav became Nepal's first President. The country began drafting a new constitution to establish federal structure and address historical grievances of marginalized communities.

CONSTITUTION OF 2015
After years of political deadlock and failure to promulgate a constitution, the devastating April 2015 earthquake created urgency for political stability. The Constituent Assembly finally adopted a new constitution on September 20, 2015, transforming Nepal into a federal democratic republic with seven provinces.

The constitution established a federal structure dividing power among federal, provincial, and local governments; a parliamentary system with President as ceremonial head and Prime Minister as executive head; bicameral federal parliament; protection of fundamental rights; and provisions for inclusion of marginalized groups.

However, the constitution faced opposition, particularly from Madhesi communities who felt inadequately represented. Protests and blockades at the India-Nepal border highlighted ethnic tensions and demands for constitutional amendments.

POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT
Since 2008, Nepal has experienced frequent government changes with no government completing its full term. Despite instability, the country has made progress in democratic consolidation, holding local, provincial, and federal elections establishing the federal structure, though challenges remain in implementing federalism effectively.

Major political parties include Nepal Communist Party (various factions), Nepali Congress, Madhesi parties, and other regional parties. Coalition governments are common, but frequent changes hinder long-term policy implementation and development.

CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION
Nepal continues strengthening democratic institutions while balancing relations with neighboring giants India and China. Corruption, political instability, and ineffective governance remain challenges. However, civil society is active, press freedom exists, and democratic processes are generally respected.

The country focuses on economic development, infrastructure building, and social justice while navigating complex geopolitics. Recent developments include infrastructure projects with both Indian and Chinese involvement, debates over citizenship laws, and ongoing efforts to address historical inequalities.

FOREIGN RELATIONS
Nepal maintains neutrality in international affairs and is a member of the United Nations, SAARC, and other organizations. Relations with India are extensive but complex, involving open border, trade agreements, and cultural ties, but also periodic tensions. Relations with China have strengthened with increased trade and infrastructure investments.

Nepal hosts significant international development assistance and UN peacekeeping contributions. The country's foreign policy emphasizes sovereignty, non-alignment, and friendship with all nations while maintaining independence in decision-making.

KEY POLITICAL FIGURES
Important historical figures include Prithvi Narayan Shah (unifier), Jung Bahadur Rana (Rana founder), King Tribhuvan (ended Rana rule), King Mahendra (Panchayat system), B.P. Koirala (first elected PM, democracy advocate), Pushpa Lal Shrestha (communist movement founder), Ganesh Man Singh (democracy movement leader), and Girija Prasad Koirala (key democratic transition figure).

Contemporary leaders include various prime ministers who have rotated through office, with political landscape dominated by shifting alliances and coalitions. The rapid changes in leadership reflect both democratic vigor and political instability that characterizes Nepal's current political situation.
