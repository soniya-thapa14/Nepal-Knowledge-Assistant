TOURISM IN NEPAL

OVERVIEW OF NEPAL TOURISM
Tourism is one of Nepal's most important economic sectors, contributing significantly to GDP, employment, and foreign exchange earnings. Nepal attracts visitors for its extraordinary natural beauty, including eight of the world's highest mountains; rich cultural heritage with UNESCO World Heritage Sites; adventure activities from mountaineering to rafting; spiritual experiences at Buddhist and Hindu sites; and diverse wildlife in national parks. The tourism industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly.

Nepal's tourism arrivals peaked at nearly 1.2 million in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline. The sector has been recovering since 2021. Major source countries for tourists include India, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, and various European nations. The average length of stay is 12-13 days, with visitors spending on accommodation, food, transportation, trekking permits, and activities.
