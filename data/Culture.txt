NEPALI CULTURE AND TRADITIONS

CULTURAL OVERVIEW
Nepali culture is a rich tapestry woven from diverse ethnic groups, religions, languages, and traditions spanning thousands of years. The country's geographical diversity has created distinct cultural regions: the mountain culture influenced by Tibetan Buddhism, the hill culture with Hindu and Buddhist blending, and the Terai culture with connections to North Indian traditions. Despite this diversity, common threads unite Nepali society including respect for elders, strong family bonds, religious devotion, hospitality, and community harmony.

FESTIVALS AND CELEBRATIONS

DASHAIN
Dashain is the biggest and most important festival in Nepal, celebrated for 15 days in September or October (according to the lunar calendar). It honors the victory of goddess Durga over the demon Mahishasura, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is marked by family reunions, with people traveling from across the country and abroad to be with their families.

During Dashain, families receive tika (a mixture of yogurt, rice, and vermillion) and jamara (yellow barley shoots) from elders as blessings. Animal sacrifices, particularly of goats and buffaloes, are offered to goddess Durga. The festival involves thorough house cleaning, new clothes, special feasts, and flying kites. Government offices and most businesses close for up to a week during the main days.

TIHAR (DEEPAWALI)
Tihar, also called the festival of lights, is the second-largest festival celebrated over five days in October or November. Each day honors different beings: crows, dogs, cows, oxen, and brothers (or the goddess Laxmi). Houses are decorated with oil lamps (diyas) and colorful lights, and intricate patterns (rangoli) are created at doorways.

During Tihar, groups of girls and boys go door-to-door singing traditional songs (bhailo and deusi) and receive money, food, and blessings. The third day, Laxmi Puja, is the main day when the goddess of wealth is worshipped. The festival emphasizes the bond between humans and animals, particularly celebrating dogs and crows who are fed and honored.

HOLI
Holi, the festival of colors, is celebrated in March with great enthusiasm, particularly in the Terai region. People throw colored powder and water at each other, dance to traditional music, and consume bhang (a cannabis-infused drink) in some communities. The festival marks the arrival of spring and celebrates the victory of good over evil through the legend of Holika and Prahlad.

BUDDHA JAYANTI
Buddha Jayanti celebrates the birth, enlightenment, and death of Lord Buddha. It falls on the full moon day in April or May. Major celebrations occur at Lumbini (Buddha's birthplace) and at Buddhist stupas like Swayambhunath and Boudhanath in Kathmandu. Devotees visit monasteries, offer prayers, light butter lamps, and participate in processions.

TEEJ
Teej is primarily a women's festival celebrated in August or September. Women, dressed in red saris, fast for the wellbeing and long life of their husbands or to pray for a good husband if unmarried. They gather at temples, particularly Pashupatinath, singing and dancing to traditional songs. The festival includes a feast the day before fasting, followed by a complete fast (no food or water) for up to 24 hours.

INDRA JATRA
Indra Jatra is an eight-day festival celebrated in Kathmandu in September, honoring Indra, the king of gods and god of rain. The festival features the procession of the Kumari (living goddess), masked dances representing deities and demons, and the chariot procession through Kathmandu's old city. A large wooden pole (yosin) is erected at Kathmandu Durbar Square.

CHHATH
Chhath is primarily celebrated in the Terai region by the Madhesi community. Devotees worship the sun god and Chhathi Maiya (goddess) by fasting and offering prayers at rivers and ponds during sunrise and sunset. The four-day festival involves ritual bathing, fasting, and offering prasad (offerings) to the setting and rising sun.

FOOD AND CUISINE
Dal Bhat is the staple food of Nepal, consisting of lentil soup (dal), rice (bhat), vegetable curry (tarkari), and pickles (achar). This meal is typically eaten twice daily and provides balanced nutrition. The saying "Dal bhat power, 24 hour" reflects its importance in Nepali life.

Momo, originally from Tibet, has become a beloved Nepali dish. These steamed dumplings can be filled with buffalo meat, chicken, vegetables, or cheese and are served with spicy tomato-based chutney. Momo is now a popular snack across all communities.

Newari cuisine is particularly rich and diverse, featuring dishes like:
- Bara: lentil pancakes
- Chatamari: rice flour crepes topped with meat or vegetables

TRADITIONAL DRESS
The national dress varies by ethnic group and region. The daura suruwal is the traditional men's outfit, consisting of a double-breasted shirt (daura) and trousers (suruwal), worn with a dhaka topi (traditional hat) and patuka (waistband). Women traditionally wear gunyu cholo (a sari-like garment with a blouse), though many wear kurta suruwal or modern clothing in cities.

Newari women wear the haku patasi (traditional black sari with red borders), while Sherpa and Tibetan women wear chuba (long dress). In the Terai, women often wear saris in the North Indian style. Traditional dress is commonly worn during festivals and formal occasions.

Modern Nepali pop and rock music has gained popularity, with artists blending traditional and contemporary styles. Lok dohori, a question-answer style folk song, is particularly popular in rural areas and during festivals.

ARTS AND CRAFTS
Nepal has a rich tradition of arts and crafts:

Thangka painting: Tibetan Buddhist scroll paintings depicting deities, mandalas, and religious scenes. These intricate paintings require years of training and are created using natural pigments.

Wood carving: Seen extensively in temples, palaces, and traditional houses, particularly in the Kathmandu Valley. Intricate windows, doors, and struts showcase this ancient art.

Metal work: Bronze and copper statues of Buddhist and Hindu deities, produced using the lost-wax casting technique. Patan is particularly famous for this craft.

Stone carving: Temples and courtyards feature elaborate stone sculptures of gods, goddesses, and mythical creatures.

Pottery: Bhaktapur is renowned for traditional pottery, with potters using techniques unchanged for centuries.

Carpet weaving: Tibetan-style carpets are woven with traditional designs and exported worldwide.

Dhaka fabric: Colorful hand-woven fabric used for topis, bags, and decorative items.

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND VALUES
Nepali society traditionally organized around caste and ethnic groups, though these distinctions are gradually diminishing in urban areas. The joint family system remains common, where multiple generations live together. Respect for elders is paramount, shown through gestures like touching their feet for blessings and speaking with honorifics.

Hospitality is a core value, with guests treated as manifestations of god ("Atithi Devo Bhava"). Arranged marriages remain common, though love marriages are increasingly accepted in urban areas. The practice of dowry persists despite being illegal.

Community participation is important, with systems like parma (labor exchange) and guthi (community organizations) facilitating collective work and preserving traditions. Religious tolerance is a defining feature, with Hindu and Buddhist festivals often celebrated together.

LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
Nepali (also called Gorkhali) is the official language, written in Devanagari script. The language has a rich literary tradition dating back centuries. Famous Nepali poets include Bhanubhakta Acharya (who translated the Ramayana into Nepali), Laxmi Prasad Devkota (author of "Muna Madan"), and Parijat.

Nepal's linguistic diversity is extraordinary, with 123 languages recognized. Major literary works exist in Newari, Maithili, Bhojpuri, and other languages. Oral traditions of storytelling, folk songs, and epics are also important cultural repositories.

RITUALS AND LIFE CEREMONIES
Nepali life is marked by various sanskars (sacraments):

Nwaran: naming ceremony for newborns
Pasni/Machhindranath: rice-feeding ceremony (first solid food)
Bratabandha/Bartaman: sacred thread ceremony for boys
Gunyo cholo/Ihi: coming-of-age ceremony for girls
Bibaha: marriage ceremonies with elaborate rituals
Antim sanskar: funeral rites and death ceremonies

These ceremonies involve specific rituals, feasts, and gatherings of family and community members.

RELIGIOUS PRACTICES
Hindu and Buddhist practices often blend in Nepal. Daily rituals include morning puja (worship), offering flowers and incense to deities, and visiting temples. Many homes have prayer rooms with images or statues of deities.

Buddhist practices include circumambulating stupas, spinning prayer wheels, hanging prayer flags, and meditation. Monasteries serve as centers of learning and spiritual practice. Pilgrimages to sacred sites like Pashupatinath, Muktinath, Swayambhunath, and Lumbini are important religious activities.

CONTEMPORARY CULTURE
Modern Nepali culture blends traditional and contemporary elements. Cities have cafes, malls, and entertainment venues alongside ancient temples. Young people embrace global culture through internet and social media while maintaining cultural roots. Nepali cinema, though small, produces films in Nepali and other languages. Television serials, music videos, and YouTube content creators are popular.

Education is highly valued, and families make significant sacrifices for children's education. Migration for work and education has increased, creating diaspora communities worldwide who maintain strong ties to Nepali culture and traditions.
