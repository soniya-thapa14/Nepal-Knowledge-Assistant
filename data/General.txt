NEPAL - GENERAL INFORMATION

BASIC FACTS
Nepal is a landlocked country located in South Asia, nestled in the Himalayas between China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. The country covers an area of 147,516 square kilometers (56,956 square miles), making it roughly the size of Arkansas or Bangladesh. Despite its relatively small size, Nepal is home to extraordinary geographical diversity, from the lowland Terai plains at 70 meters above sea level to Mount Everest at 8,848.86 meters, the highest point on Earth.

The official name is the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. The capital and largest city is Kathmandu, with a metropolitan population exceeding 3 million people. Nepal's total population is approximately 30 million people, making it the 48th most populous country in the world.

GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
Nepal can be divided into three main geographical regions: the Terai (lowland plains in the south), the Hill Region (central mountains and valleys), and the Mountain Region (high Himalayas in the north). This dramatic variation in elevation creates diverse climate zones ranging from tropical in the Terai to arctic conditions in the high mountains.

The country experiences four main seasons: spring (March to May), monsoon season (June to August), autumn (September to November), and winter (December to February). The monsoon brings heavy rainfall, particularly to the eastern regions, while the western areas remain relatively dry. Nepal receives about 80% of its annual precipitation during the monsoon season.

POLITICAL SYSTEM
Nepal transitioned from a monarchy to a federal democratic republic in 2008, ending 240 years of royal rule. The country is now divided into seven provinces, each with its own provincial government. The federal government operates under a multi-party system with a President as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. The Parliament consists of two houses: the House of Representatives (275 members) and the National Assembly (59 members).

DEMOGRAPHICS AND LANGUAGES
Nepal is extraordinarily diverse ethnically and linguistically. The country recognizes 125 distinct ethnic groups and 123 languages as mother tongues. Nepali is the official language and lingua franca, spoken by about 44% of the population as a first language and understood by most citizens. Other major languages include Maithili, Bhojpuri, Tharu, Tamang, Newar, Bajjika, Magar, Doteli, Urdu, and Awadhi.

The major ethnic groups include Chhetri (16.6%), Brahmin-Hill (12.2%), Magar (7.1%), Tharu (6.6%), Tamang (5.8%), Newar (5%), Muslim (4.4%), Kami (3.9%), and Yadav (3.9%), among many others. This ethnic diversity is a defining characteristic of Nepali society.

RELIGION
Nepal is constitutionally a secular state, though it has deep religious roots. Hinduism is the predominant religion, practiced by about 81.3% of the population. Buddhism is the second-largest religion at 9%, and these two faiths have coexisted harmoniously for centuries, often blending together in practice. Islam accounts for 4.4% of the population, and Christianity about 1.4%. Many indigenous groups practice their own traditional religions.

Nepal is the birthplace of Lord Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), who was born in Lumbini around 563 BCE. The country is home to numerous sacred sites for both Hindus and Buddhists, including Pashupatinath Temple, Swayambhunath Stupa, and Boudhanath Stupa.

ECONOMY
Nepal is classified as a least developed country with a GDP of approximately $40 billion. The economy is primarily based on agriculture (which employs about 65% of the population), remittances from Nepali workers abroad (accounting for about 25% of GDP), and tourism. Major agricultural products include rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, milk, and potatoes.

Remittances are crucial to Nepal's economy, with millions of Nepalis working abroad, particularly in the Gulf countries, Malaysia, and India. Tourism is another vital sector, with visitors drawn to Nepal's mountains, cultural heritage, and adventure activities. The country welcomed nearly 1.2 million tourists in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Major industries include tourism, carpets, textiles, rice, jute, sugar, and oilseed mills. Hydroelectric power represents significant potential for economic development, though only a fraction of Nepal's estimated 83,000 MW potential has been developed.

EDUCATION SYSTEM
Nepal has made significant progress in education over recent decades. The literacy rate has increased to about 67.9% overall, with male literacy at 78.6% and female literacy at 59.7%. Education is structured into primary (grades 1-5), lower secondary (grades 6-8), secondary (grades 9-10), higher secondary (grades 11-12), and tertiary levels.

Tribhuvan University, established in 1959, is the oldest and largest university in Nepal. Other major universities include Kathmandu University, Pokhara University, and Purbanchal University. The government provides free education up to the secondary level, though quality varies significantly between urban and rural areas.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
Nepal faces significant infrastructure challenges due to its mountainous terrain. The road network totals about 27,000 kilometers, though many roads are unpaved and become impassable during the monsoon season. The country has no railway system connecting major cities, though a small railway operates near the Indian border.

Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu is the only international airport, though several domestic airports serve remote regions. Internet and mobile phone penetration has grown rapidly, with over 80% of the population having access to mobile phones.

CURRENT CHALLENGES AND DEVELOPMENT
Nepal faces several development challenges including poverty (about 25% of the population lives below the poverty line), political instability, corruption, brain drain, and vulnerability to natural disasters. The devastating 2015 earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage, highlighting the country's seismic vulnerability.

Climate change poses particular threats to Nepal, affecting glacial melt, water resources, and agricultural patterns. The country is working to develop renewable energy, particularly hydropower, and to improve infrastructure, healthcare, and education systems.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
Nepal maintains a policy of neutrality in international affairs and is a member of the United Nations, SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), and various other international organizations. The country maintains diplomatic relations with most nations and serves as a bridge between its giant neighbors, India and China.

Nepal's foreign policy is guided by the principles of the UN Charter, non-alignment, Panchsheel (five principles of peaceful coexistence), international law, and the value of world peace. The country contributes peacekeeping forces to UN missions and is recognized for its soldiers' professionalism and dedication.

NATIONAL SYMBOLS
The national flag of Nepal is unique as the world's only non-rectangular national flag. It consists of two stacked triangles in crimson red with blue borders, containing symbols of the moon and sun. The crimson represents the bravery of Nepali people, while blue signifies peace.

The national anthem is "Sayaun Thunga Phulka," adopted in 2007. The national flower is the rhododendron (Lali Gurans), the national animal is the cow, the national bird is the Himalayan Monal (Danphe), and the national sport is volleyball, though cricket and football are more popular.

CURRENCY AND MEASUREMENTS
The Nepali Rupee (NPR) is the official currency, with coins and banknotes issued by Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank. The rupee is pegged to the Indian Rupee at a rate of 1.6 NPR to 1 INR. Nepal follows the Vikram Samvat calendar for official purposes, which is 56.7 years ahead of the Gregorian calendar, though the Gregorian calendar is also widely used.

TIME ZONE AND COMMUNICATION
Nepal Standard Time is UTC+5:45, making it one of only three time zones with a 45-minute offset. The country code for Nepal is +977. Internet access has expanded rapidly, with major cities having good connectivity, though rural areas still lag behind in digital infrastructure.
